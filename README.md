# CucumberTemplate
Template cucumber project with a single example scenario.

The template demonstrates how to create a devcontainer in visual studio to write, execute and debug gherkin. The devcontainer is based on a docker image that is also used to execute the same tests in jenkins.

The project is my template for my own use in real projects, please feel free to use if its helpful.
